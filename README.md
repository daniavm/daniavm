- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Valdés Medel (@daniavm)
- 👀 I’m interested in people who want to be able to work mainly in scientific dissemination, data science or design tasks to find a way to make it possible for the world community to have the necessary tools to approach a scientific environment and allow it to make better decisions or opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything about Data Science Tools and Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies that have to do with technology or education, since I think I have a lot to contribute in these areas in terms of data analysis and decision making.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can simply write an email 📩 or checking my work in Github o Twitter  ;)
